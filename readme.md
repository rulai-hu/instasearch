## InstaSearch

Enter a valid hashtag. Hit search. Images with that tag come through; it's that simple.

## Setup

You'll need composer and PHP 5.4 or higher.

Don't forget to:

    cd /path/to/repo
    composer install --no-scripts
    composer update

Then add:

    INSTAGRAM_SECRET=YOUR_API_KEY

to the .env file.
